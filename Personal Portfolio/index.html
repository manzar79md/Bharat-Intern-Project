            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <p>HTML is known as Hyper Text Markup Language. This language is specially used for web development where the developer is using this language to write the data which we tell them as skeleton of the website.</p>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets. This is one of the most important language in web development because this is the one language which makes the website beautiful and more attractive. So this language is used to design the website or webpage.</p>
            <li>C & C++</li>
            <p>C is a procedural programming language with a static system that has the functionality of structured programming and it is not most used in webdevelopment whereas C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.And also C++ is used in webdevelopment in back-end development. </p> 
            <li>Java</li>
            <p>Java plays a significant role in web development, especially on the server side. It provides a robust and scalable foundation for building enterprise-level applications and services.</p>
            <li>Python</li>
            <p>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.Python's readability, simplicity, and versatility make it a popular choice for web development. Whether we're building a small web application or a large-scale project, Python and its frameworks provide the tools and libraries needed to get the job done efficiently.</p>
